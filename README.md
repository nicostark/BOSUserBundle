# BuddiesOfSymfony/UserBundle
This a simple Symfony2 bundle to handle basic user management. PHP 5.5.0 as minimum is needed.

# Important
Notice that this bundle it's on alpha stage. It's currently working, but improvements are needed.

# What does it do?
This bundle will allow you to create users, update them, handle logins and logouts, and restrict URLs to only logged in users with a single annotation.

# Why is it so simple?
I needed a nice way to handle my users and i tried to install FOSUserBundle. Although it's a great development, i found, as many other people, that they tried to make it "too much" adaptable. At the point that it's no longer friendly code.

# Installation
- First of all, add the package to composer: "composer require buddiesofsymfony/user-bundle"
- Once you installed it, run "./composer.phar update" to download the bundle.

# Use and configuration
Please check the wiki section. Don't worry, it's very very simple.
